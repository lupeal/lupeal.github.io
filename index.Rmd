I am a Biostatistics PhD student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Currently, I am involved in the Biostatistics Computing Club, where we hold sessions for all students.

In May 2023, I obtained my B.A. from Mount Holyoke College, where I pursued a double major in Statistics and Psychology. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with induction into Mu Sigma Rho, the National Statistics Honor Society.
